Xcode Visual Studio Theme
=======================

This is a minimalist theme for Xcode with the look&feel of the Visual Studio's Dark Theme we all ❤

Edited to match my VS look set xcode to dark for full effect. Almost same as original just a few tweaks thanks Kutyel!

Installation
=======================

1. Open the file CONSOLA.TTF
2. Install the font
3. Copy the theme file to the folder `(~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/)`
4. Restart Xcode
5. Apply theme `(Xcode > Preferences > Fonts & Colors)`
